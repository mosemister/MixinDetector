# MixinDetector

Designed to detect all mods and plugins that use Sponge Mixins as well as the Mixin file that the file contains.

You can then filter the results by name, date or even crash log. But also by clicking on a mod/plugin it will take you to its support page (if one is found) for you to search for incompatibilities and hopefully a fix, if not hopefully you can then report the issue for fixing
